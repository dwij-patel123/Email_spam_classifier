## Email Spam Classifier

#### About The Project

This project consists of a dataset that contains the information that the e-mail is a spam or not. This NoteBook consists of training the data on three models that is SVC, SGDClassifier and GaussianNB.
It also consists a pipeline to preprocess the data and then training on different models. The performance of the models are checked through confusion matrix of predicted outputs and true outputs.

#### Acurracy of All Models

- SVC - 97%
- SGDClassifier - 97.6%
- GaussianNB - 96%

#### Follow Up of the Project

- As you can see from the accuracies the SVC model performs the best according to its confusion matrix.
- We could train the data on even more models to check their accuracies such as DecisionTreeClassifier,LogisticRegression etc.
